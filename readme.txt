Project: Multimedia Player in C++ with CI/CD Integration

Description:
Create a multimedia player in C++ that plays audio and video files. This project aims to showcase various skills expected from a junior C++ developer, including file handling, user interface design, multimedia processing, and modern software development practices like CI/CD integration.

Key Features:

File Handling:

Implement a file management system for various multimedia formats.
Allow users to load, play, pause, and stop multimedia files.
User Interface Design:

Develop a simple and intuitive user interface using C++.
Include features like play, pause, stop buttons, volume control, and a progress bar for tracking playback.
Multimedia Processing:

Utilize multimedia libraries (e.g., FFmpeg for video, and OpenAL or SDL for audio) for decoding and playback.
Implement basic multimedia processing functionalities like volume control, seeking, and track duration.
Object-Oriented Design:

Organize the code into well-structured classes and structures.
Implement a modular design, separating concerns such as UI, file handling, and multimedia processing.
Build System and Version Control:

Use Git for version control to track project changes.
Implement CMake as the build system for compiling and building the project.
Continuous Integration (CI):

Set up a CI pipeline using a CI service (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions).
Configure CI jobs to automatically build and test the project whenever changes are pushed to the repository.
Automated Testing:

Implement unit tests to ensure the correctness of key functionalities.
Include integration tests to verify the overall behavior of the multimedia player.
Continuous Deployment (CD):

Configure CD jobs to automatically deploy the application when changes are merged into the main branch and all tests pass.
Explore options for distributing the multimedia player (e.g., creating installers or packages).
Brief Question:
Develop a multimedia player in C++ that incorporates the following aspects:

Efficient file handling for various multimedia formats.
A user-friendly interface with play, pause, stop buttons, volume control, and a progress bar.
Utilization of multimedia libraries (e.g., FFmpeg, OpenAL or SDL) for decoding and playback.
A modular and well-structured design using classes and structures.
Implementation of a CI/CD pipeline using a chosen CI service (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions) for automated building, testing, and deployment.
Integration of automated testing, including unit tests and integration tests.
This question aims to assess your skills in C++ programming, multimedia processing, object-oriented design, build systems (CMake), version control (Git), and modern development practices with CI/CD integration.
